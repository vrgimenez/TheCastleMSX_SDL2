## 2025-05-16 — Tile loading rewrite

### Changed

- **tiles.c**: Replaced hardcoded `VRAM_TILES[185][16]` array (from openMSX VRAM dumps)
  with runtime loading from the game ROM file. A lookup table maps each VRAM index to
  its ROM address. Unmapped tiles fall back to BLANK.

- **room.c (load_tileset)**: Fixed tile data reading to use raw 16-byte interleaved
  format from ROM directly, instead of incorrect pointer-indirection through a
  non-existent pointer table.

### Fixed

- **tiles.c (TILE_MAP)**: Corrected title block B ROM address from `0x9926` to `0x81A6`
  (verified against title-screen VRAM dump).

- **tiles.c (TILE_MAP)**: Added missing gameplay wall tiles `0x73-0x74` at `0x89C6`
  and `0x76` at `0x8976` (these sit after the 26-tile WALLS block and were previously
  unmapped, rendering as BLANK).

### Removed

- **vram_tiles.c**: Deleted (duplicate VRAM dump data, was already commented out
  in CMakeLists.txt).

### Notes

- All tiles in ROM are raw 16-byte interleaved MSX format (8 pattern bytes +
  8 color bytes). NOT compressed as previously assumed.
- ROM descriptor table: 0x7BC0-0x7BC6 store full 16-bit addresses; 0x7BC8+ use
  compact format (context-dependent hi byte).
- **All 185 tiles now mapped** to verified ROM addresses (19-entry TILE_MAP).
- Title-screen tile blocks: A (0x77-0x87 @ 0x9116), B (0x88-0x95 @ 0x81A6),
  C (0x96-0xB8 @ 0x8286), decorative borders use BG1_MAIN (0x8056) at 0x73-0x76.
- Gameplay wall tiles: main WALLS block 0x59-0x72 @ 0x8796 (26 tiles), plus
  0x73-0x74 @ 0x89C6, 0x75-0x76 @ 0x8966 (not contiguous with main block).
