## 2025-05-16 — Tile loading rewrite

### Changed

- **tiles.c**: Replaced hardcoded `VRAM_TILES[185][16]` array (from openMSX VRAM dumps)
  with runtime loading from the game ROM file. A lookup table maps each VRAM index to
  its ROM address. Unmapped tiles fall back to BLANK.

- **room.c (load_tileset)**: Fixed tile data reading to use raw 16-byte interleaved
  format from ROM directly, instead of incorrect pointer-indirection through a
  non-existent pointer table.

### Removed

- **vram_tiles.c**: Deleted (duplicate VRAM dump data, was already commented out
  in CMakeLists.txt).

### Notes

- All tiles in ROM are raw 16-byte interleaved MSX format (8 pattern bytes +
  8 color bytes). NOT compressed as previously assumed.
- ROM descriptor table: 0x7BC0-0x7BC6 store full 16-bit addresses; 0x7BC8+ use
  compact format (context-dependent hi byte).
- Verified ~150+ tiles by pattern-matching against the original VRAM dump.
